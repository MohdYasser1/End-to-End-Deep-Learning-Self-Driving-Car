# End-to-End-Deep-Learning-Self-Driving-Car
This NoteBook is about using deep-learning to take images captured by a simulator that is driven by myself. The goal of this project is to try several famous deep-learning architecture as well as trying one by self.
### The content of this NoteBook will include:
1. Self-Made architecture
2. Nvidea's architecture for Self-Driving cars (Comming Soon ...)
3. An upgrade for the Nvidea's architecture using Feature Analysis and Selection (Comming Soon ...)
4. End-to-End Learning with Memory Models (Comming Soon ...)
